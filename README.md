## Final Notes

This project wasn't as challenging as the previous one, but it had its own difficulty. I faced a choice between getting it to act exactly as I wanted and truly understanding my code. In the learning process, I judged as more important to be able to explain the intricacies of the code rather than simply delivering results. This way, one could avoid crashing due to a lack of fundamentals. While it's not down to the letter of what I wanted it to be it's still a successful outcome. The functionalities run smoothly, and the finished product meets all its requirements. As a beginner in JavaScript, it is to be expected that I won't be able to bring to life everything that I envision, but I'm committed to keep working and improving to push the limits of my skills.
